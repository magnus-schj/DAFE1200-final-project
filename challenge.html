        In 2016 the United Nations put forth 17 sustainable development goals to prevent drastic changes in the
        climat by the end of 2030.One of these goals is based on responsible consumption and prodduction. Already in
        2007 the Norwegian government wrote a document where they had a goal for Norway to be the leading country for
        sustainable development. To reach this goal the population of Norway needs to recycle their waste so it can
        become new materials in an efficient and eco-friendly way. But still in 2020 we are not good enough to recyle.

        In 2019 each citisen of Norway prodused 427 kg of waste. The same year only 173,9 kg of waste per person got
        deliverd to recyling. Waste that does not get recycled gets sendt to a facility where they burn it all to
        produce heat and it becomes useless ash. That is why it is important to recycle so this material does not og
        to waste, but rather can be recreated into other products. This save the enviroment from the exration of raw material.

        Green Point Norway did a survey on Norwegian citisens on why they do not recycle. One of the reasons that
        people often gave was that they donâ€™t get anything back for the time spent on recycling. Check out our
        solution to this problem.
