                        <p>A part of the United Nations’ goal of responsible consumption and production focuses on resource
                            efficiency. This implies that the resources used to make different products must be recycled so
                            the material is not lost and can be reused. Norway already has a solution to recycle plastic
                            bottles, but there are still problems with other kinds of waste. That is why our goal is to make
                            it more attractive for the general public to recycle.
    
                            Our goal is to make Norway better at recycling and becoming more resource efficient. As soon as
                            we have made a difference in the Norwegian population, we will branch out across the world.

                            [App name] is an app that gives you points when you 
                            register that you have recycled a product correctly.
                            If you for example have a broken TV screen, and recycle it responsibly, 
                            you get a certain amount of point that you can use to get various perks, 
                            provided by our partners. This can be anything from a free movie ticket 
                            to the chance of winning a new car. -->
                            <!-- The concept of the app is that you register what you recycle, and get rewarded
                            points.
                            For example, if you have a broken TV that you recycle through our app, you earn an amount of points that you can use for various goods and deals
                            provided by our partners. This can be anything from a free movie ticket, to a chance of
                            winning a car. -->
                            As mentioned on our problem site, a lot of people don’t recycle because they get nothing
                            in return. That is why our company has developed a method to repay the people who recycle
                            in different ways. We want to give back to the people who are doing a great service to
                            our society and our planet.

                            Depending on the type of waste you recycle, you will be given points which you can use on

                            It is important for us to keep the process sustainable, even after you are done recycling. We have strict requirements to our partners 
                            of how they handle their part. For example, we will not start a partnership with an organization that will handle the waste in a 
                            un-sustainable, dangerous, or otherwise irresponsibly way. Of our partners that provide rewards and perks, we requiere that they have 
                            a good history with being responsible and sustainable. We will never offer rewards that may lead to unresponsible consumtion, or that is
                            unproper in any other way.
