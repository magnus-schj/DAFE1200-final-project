                            you get a certain amount of point that you can use to get various perks, 
                            provided by our partners. This can be anything from a free movie ticket 
                            to the chance of winning a new car. -->
                            The concept of the app is that you register what you recycle, and get rewarded points. 
                            For example, if you have a broken TV that you recycle through our app, you earn an amount of points that you can use for various goods and deals
                            provided by our partners. This can be anything from a free movie ticket, to a chance of winning a car.

                            It is important for us to keep the process sustainable, even after you are done recycling. We have strict requirements to our partners 
                            of how they handle their part. For example, we will not start a partnership with an organization that will handle the waste in a 
                            un-sustainable, dangerous, or otherwise irresponsibly way. Of our partners that provide rewards and perks, we requiere that they have 
                            a good history with being responsible and sustainable. We will never offer rewards that may lead to unresponsible consumtion, or that is
                            unproper in any other way.
