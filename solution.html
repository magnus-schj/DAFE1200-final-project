                        <p tabindex="11">A part of the United Nations’ goal of responsible consumption and production focuses on resource
                            efficiency. This implies that the resources used to make different products must be recycled so
                            the material is not lost and can be reused. Norway already has a solution to recycle plastic
                            bottles, but there are still problems with other kinds of waste. That is why our goal is to make
                            it more attractive for the general public to recycle.<br><br>
       
                            Our goal is to make Norway better at recycling and becoming more resource efficient. As soon as
                            we have made a difference in the Norwegian population, we will branch out across the world.

                            As mentioned on our <a href="problem.html">challenge</a> site, a lot of people don’t
                            recycle because they get
                                                             nothing
                            in return. That is why our company has developed a method to repay the people who recycle
                            in different ways. We want to give back to the people who are doing a great service to
                            our society and our planet. 
                        </p>

                            <b>PawnPoint</b> will give the people an option to get discounts on different products and even
                            win prizes by recycling their waste. By using our app, you can locate our nearest
                            recycling station. Here you can scan your waste and put them in the right containers.
                            Depending on the type of waste you recycle, you will be given points which you can use on
                            discounts given to us by our sponsors. You can also use your points to win small or big
                            prizes from our lottery. If you want to know more about how the app works, check out our
                            app page.

                            The waste that we collect will be transported to stations that will handle the waste in
                            an efficient and environmentally friendly way. All the material will then be sold back to
                            companies so that they can make new products. By doing this we will create a circle of
                            renewable resources that can be used over and over. This makes it unnecessary for
                            production of new resources and extraction of raw material.

                            It is important for us to keep the process sustainable, even after you are done recycling. We have strict requirements to our partners 
                            of how they handle their part. For example, we will not start a partnership with an organization that will handle the waste in a 
                            un-sustainable, dangerous, or otherwise irresponsibly way. Of our partners that provide rewards and perks, we requiere that they have 
                            a good history with being responsible and sustainable. We will never offer rewards that may lead to unresponsible consumtion, or that is
                            unproper in any other way.
